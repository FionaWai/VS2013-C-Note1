1. try / catch / finally

try
{
}
catch(Exception e)
{
#if debug
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
#endif
    throw(e);
}

2. Assert

#if debug
    Debug.Assert(value.Length % == 0, " erro message!");// 1st parameter:condition; 2nd parameter: show erro message
#endif

3. Log

Write a Log file to record actions the programs make. It's a good way to know what was happened in the system.
